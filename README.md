===================

Technologies

* JavaScript/JQuery
* HTML
* CSS

There is a button on the DOM. Each time it is clicked it should pick the next work from the poem/quote `hughesPoem` array and append it to the DOM. You should write a function to do the appending and update the `currentIndex` counter, so that the next time the button is clicked the next word is appended. Once the end of the array is reached, the counter to reset to zero and the appending should start over at the beginning of the array.
